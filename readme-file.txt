Welcome to the code for my portfolio website (a current work in progress)! 

This project was made with create-react-app, styling done with CSS and Bootstrap and 3D components done with Three.js

To do:
need:
- Update 3D Modeling and Animation section
- Render some raytracer examples and add to code section
- Create demo reel and add it to demo section

nice to have:
- Make a better See Project! button
- Fix about page on window resize
- fix styling on deployed site
- make a loading still image of 3d 
-fix image modal for mobile
